Current Tasks:
- [ ] Implement current and voltage value check for consumption
- [x] Deploy dees ticket lambda
- [x] Database - New Timezone views for hourly, daily and monthly

Things to discuss:
DEES:
- Completed changes:
	- Changed tariff ratio to cumulative
	- Added None for analytics pattern without savings calculation
	- Master and Child lambda control
	- Lambda defined runtime (means now we can choose execution time instead of fixed to current time)
	- Function to run for applet if error occurred or testing
- Questions:
	- Runtime currently at 12am each day
	- RM is now empty, need to use -NA-? (also in odr)
	- Demand Profile and Load Profile (highest + threshold)
	- Rerun for prod today?
	- Need to show efficiency config in ODR as well
	
Timezone views
- Completed changes:
	- New views for hour, day and month based on 30min aggregate instead of hypertables
	- Views have latency
- Questions:
	- Use materialized views or advanced timescaleDB continuous aggregates
	- Materialized views: preprocessed data for fast execution but need to be refreshed manually (Cron Job or call refresh function)
	- TimescaleDB continuous aggregates: Maintains automatically using policy
	- Remove current daily and hourly hypertables for timezones as well
	
MQTT Checker
- Completed changes:
	- Added handling for message errors
	- Added notification sending if MQTT Broker(devices >10) are down
	- Haven't had any issues yet since yesterday
- Questions:
	- Lambda is able to handle multiple connections without needing child lambda
	- Broker refused connection for some reason
	- Testing inconclusive since issue was fixed when i got more in depth

- Notification History Time is in UTC instead of timezone
- Notification Counter Daily?
